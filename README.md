Introduction to MacType
---------------------
MacType is a brand new product which turns your windows into a Mac! With the power of freetype, it can render your windows font smoothly and much more convenient to read. This product is redeveloped from GDI++, a Japanese project which is no longer updating years ago. MacType is now more powerful than gdipp. Support chrome 18+, GTK and even safari!

Project website on [Google Code](https://code.google.com/p/mactype/).

Instructions
---------------------
Please download the latest version of MacType and download the config file to /(mactype)/bin/ini/ folder. If you choose not to install any config files in the installation wizard, you would probably not see the ini folder. You need to create one yourself.

Once you put the config file to the ini folder, run the configuration wizard and choose a mode (registry mode is recommended) and choose XHei.OSX config. Restart your system and enjoy!
